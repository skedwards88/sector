This app was built with plain JS/HTML as an exercise to compare to building with React.

`workbox-config.js` was generated with using workbox:
`npm install workbox-cli --save-dev`
`npx workbox wizard`

Then the service worker is generated: `workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` (also saved as `npm run build`).

Run locally with `npm start`. (Served with express.)
